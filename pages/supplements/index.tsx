        <p>There are many supplements you can take, but the most important ones are:</p>
        <ul className="mt-5 list-disc text-left w-[50rem] flex flex-col gap-5">
          <li>
            MCT Oil - This oil is composed of fat that burns fast. This helps the fat-burning
            process faster, skipping glucose in the energy order. The oil also gives you more energy
            quickly as fat burns slow, making you feel tired sometimes.{' '}
          </li>
          <li>
            Keto BHB - BHB is a type of ketone hormone that is created during ketosis. If you take
            BHB, youâ€™re essentially giving your body extra ketones to burn fat. Taking this does not
            automatically put you in ketosis, but it does help start it or amplify it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fish Oil (Omega-3) - Omega-3s are important because they stimulate the burning of fat in
            your body, helping you to further amplify your ketosis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Multivitamins - Again, it is more important to be healthy than to lose weight. If you
            ignore your vitamins and nutrients, you will not succeed in Keto for the long-run. You
            may stall a lot and get stuck.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </>
