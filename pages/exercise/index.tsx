            Do you have to exercise often for this diet? Absolutely not! You donâ€™t have to go to the
            gym everyday or run around the block a thousand times. However, if you really want to
            increase the effectiveness of this diet, it is highly recommended that you at least be
            lightly active. You can run maybe a few times a week and lift weights a few times a
            week. Better yet, if you&apos;re the athletic or fitness type, work out a lot! Again
            though, don&apos;t worry about exercising too much. Just try not to be a couch potato.

            The goal is to burn the more calories than you intake. If you are unable to excercise
            for any reason, simply in take less calories. Your body already burns calories by simply
            sustaining itself. See the section of <b>basal metabolic rate</b> for more information
            on this.
